### Scope

This implementation guide specifies imaging study report data in the **European** context, as defined in {{ehnImaging}} and refined by {{XtEhrImaging}}, as a FHIR model. It defines:
* The structure and contents of a FHIR imaging study report.
* Mapping between this IG and the Xt-EHR logical models for imaging reports, as functional requirements.
* Example implementations of the defined models for Imaging Study Reports.
* Relation of this specification with the existing ecosystem, including IHE MADO, IHE RAD, and EHDS API specifications.

This specification has been designed to be compatible with {{EuridiceHealthDataAPI}}.

### Relationship and scope boundaries

This guide is part of the broader European EHDS-aligned interoperability landscape and focuses on the imaging report model and related access patterns. It is designed to be complementary to other EHDS family guides and to remain interoperable with established IHE workflows.

In particular, this guide aligns with {{iheMADO}} / {{manifest}} and related IHE document exchange infrastructure. The separation between report and manifest is intentional:
* The report communicates the clinician-authored interpretation and supporting clinical content.
* The manifest communicates imaging-study inventory and retrieval context for DICOM access.

This split preserves clinical traceability while avoiding coupling report content to potentially changing image-location endpoints. Historically, report workflows (RIS/EHR-centric) and image-storage workflows (PACS-centric) evolved in different technical stacks, and this guide keeps that separation explicit while keeping both artifacts linkable.

For operational workflows, both directions are expected:
* starting from a report, discover the related manifest;
* starting from a manifest, discover the related report(s).

In both directions, [[[ImagingStudy]]] identifiers such as StudyInstanceUID and order-level identifiers such as accession-number are key matching anchors.

### Purpose

The goal of this Implementation Guide is to define an European standard for the Imaging Report to facilitate the harmonization among the national initiatives and prepare the ground for the European EHR eXchange Format (E-EHRxF).

The development of this implementation guide is promoted by HL7 Europe, but realized in collaboration with several other European and national organizations and projects. The aspiration of this guide is to be used as basis for European National Guides, the European EHRxF ,and - consequently - by MyHealth@EU for the EU cross-border services.
